# Roads of Code

Personal project of a traffic simulator with a bigger focus on trying to replicate steering behaviours. Higly influentiated by the work of Daniel Shiffman in the book Nature of Code.

### Running

The project is developed using Python 3.6 and the pygame library, so you need both to run it.

### Acknowladgments

I know I use a Camaro in the project but please don't sue me, General Motors.
